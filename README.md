# MtxIa

This project is for learning proposal of Rust, Bevy and AI

## Stages

Stage 1:
 - [x] Load textures
 - [x] Load TiledMap
 - [x] Render Map
 - [x] Camera move with mouse
 - [x] Zoom with mouse
 - [x] Create fish with random position on map
  
Stage 2:
 - [X] Create fish sensor
 - [X] Move forward
 - [X] Detect collision 
 - [X] Recreate fish after collision
  
Stage 3:
 - [X] Info painel
 - [X] Select item
 - [X] Fish energy
 - [X] Fish Speed
 - [X] Fish Die

Stage 4:
 - [X] Configuration with Yaml
 - [X] Introduction to neural network
 - [X] Learn turn right/left do avoid collision
 - [X] Create mutiples fishes and keep best weight
 - [X] Serialize best generations results
 - [X] Deserialize results on fish creation
 - [X] Enhanced panel display data
 - [X] Tunning collision performance
 - [X] Save CSV summary on generation finish

Stage 5:
 - [ ] Add PyTorch with tch-rs
 - [ ] Learn speed up and down
 - [ ] Seek for food
